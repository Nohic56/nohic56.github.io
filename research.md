## Research Overview

My research focuses on understanding the temporal regulation of the cell cycle
through the integration of quantitative proteomics, bioinformatics, and
experimental cell biology. I develop computational approaches to analyze
large-scale mass spectrometry datasets and connect them to mechanistic models.
