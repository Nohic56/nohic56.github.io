## Research Projects

My research focuses on understanding the regulation of dynamic biological systems by combining **quantitative proteomics, computational analysis, and experimental biology**. Below are selected research projects spanning my PhD and postdoctoral work.

## Postdoctoral Research

### Temporal regulation of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C)

**Biological question**  
How is APC/C activity temporally controlled during mitosis, and how does progressive phosphorylation contribute to cell cycle timing?

**Approach**  
This project integrates:
- Quantitative mass spectrometry (DIA)
- Structural mass spectrometry crosslinking strategies
- *Xenopus laevis* egg extracts as a cell-cycle model system

**Key findings**
- Progressive phosphorylation of APC/C components acts as a **mitotic timing mechanism**
- Identification of phosphorylation patterns correlated with APC/C activation states
- Quantitative mapping of regulatory interactions during mitotic progression

**Tools & technologies**
`MaxQuant` · `PEAKS` · `DIA-NN` · Custom `Python/C++` pipelines ·

## Doctoral Research (PhD)

### Quantification of proteome variations at the intact protein level

**Research objective**  
To develop robust experimental and computational strategies for quantifying proteome changes using a new  isotope labeling approaches.

**Methods developed**
- Isotope-based metabolic labeling (SLIM / bSLIM)
- Signal processing and statistical analysis of quantitative MS data
- Integration of bottom-up and top-down proteomics workflows

**Key outcomes**
- Development of open-source algorithms for quantitative proteomics
- Application to pathogenic yeast *Candida albicans*
- Author of **three first-author peer-reviewed publications**

**Scientific impact**
This work provided new computational frameworks to assess quantitative confidence in proteomics experiments and enabled deeper interpretation of proteome variability.
