        <p>Hello! My name is Nicolas, and I’m originally from Paris, though I proudly hail from Brittany in France.</p>
        <p>I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s in Interdisciplinary Sciences at Paris Descartes University.</p>
        <p>For my PhD, I worked at the <strong>Institut Jacques Monod</strong> (Camadro's Lab) where I focused on developing novel quantitative methods for proteomics. This allowed me to combine computational techniques with experimental biology, creating a synergy between in-silico (computational) and in-vivo (experimental) approaches using mass spectrometry.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a Post-doctoral Researcher in <a href="https://www.kamenzlab.com/people" style="color: dodgerblue;">Julia Kamenz’s Lab</a>, applying my expertise to study the dynamics of the cell cycle in different organisms, using Xenopus eggs as a model system.</p>
        <p>Outside the lab, I’m a proud Breton, and I enjoy sea-related activities such as <span id="typed"></span>. I’ve also recently picked up skateboarding as a new hobby!</p>

        <h5>Abstract:</h5>
        <p>
            One of the most challenging problems in modern biology is analyzing proteome variations in terms of composition and structure. This is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of gene expression and regulation under normal and pathological conditions. In mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the Simple Light Isotope Metabolic (SLIM) labeling technique has proven to be a highly effective tool for deeply analyzing complex proteomes, both in bottom-up and top-down experiments.
            <br><br>
            The main objectives of my PhD were: 
            <br>1) To develop robust statistical approaches for analyzing SLIM-based quantitative proteomics data.
            <br>2) To apply the SLIM strategy to analyze proteoform variations in pathogenic yeast (<i>Candida albicans</i>) as a model organism, in order to establish systems biology approaches.
            <br>3) To extend these methods to more complex proteomes from higher eukaryotic cells. 
            <br><br>
            The techniques developed during my PhD were applied to analyze pathological conditions in humans, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders like Friedreich Ataxia, where phenotypic expression is highly dependent on genomic structure.
