Hi! My name is Nicolas, I am from Paris (but originally from Brittany).
I studied Interdisciplinary Sciences for my Bachelor and Master in Paris Descartes University.
I performed my PhD at the Institut Jacques Monod (Camadro’s Lab) where I worked on the development of new quantitative approaches for proteomics.
This work allows me to combine theoretical and computational methods with biological and experimental techniques.
The mass spectrometer instrument was used as a powerful tool to link between in-silico (computational) and in-vivo (experimental) approaches.
I am now a Post-doc in Julia’s team to apply my recently acquired skills to new biological organisms and questions such as studying cell cycle dynamics using Xenopus eggs.
Outside the lab, as a proud “Breton”, I enjoy various sea-related activities such as <span id="typed"></span>.
Recently, I've also taken an interest in skateboarding.

  <h5>Abstract :</h5>
  <p>
    One of the most challenging problems in modern biology is to address at the experimental level the analysis of the dynamics of 
	proteome variations in composition and structure in order to decipher the fundamental mechanisms of gene expression and regulation 
	in normal and pathological conditions. In mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the newly developed Simple Light Isotope Metabolic 
	(SLIM) labeling strategy appears to be highly effective to analyze with an unprecedented depth complex proteome in bottom-up and top-down 
	experiments. The aims of this thesis will be: First, to develop robust statistical analysis of the SLIM-labeling based quantitative proteomics
	procedures. Second, to implement the SLIM-labeling strategy to analyze the quantitative variations of proteoforms in top-down experiments on pathogenic
	yeast (<i>Candida albicans</i>) as model organism to establish robust systems biology approaches. Finally, to implement these methods and protocols on more complex 
	proteome of higher eukaryote cells. The data collection and analysis pipelines set during this work will be applied to the molecular characterization of a
	number of pathological conditions in humans. We will use different growth media and drugs treatment to evaluate the proteome variations associated to several 
	cell lines from a fatal neurodegenerative disorder studied in the lab (Friedriech Ataxia) where the phenotypic expression is highly dependent on the genomics 
	structure.
