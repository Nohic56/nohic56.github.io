Title : New quantification approaches of proteome variations at the intact proteins level: experimental and computational analyses of pathological conditions in humans.

Titre de la thèse: Nouvelles approches quantitatives des variations du protéome au niveau des protéines intactes: analyses expérimentales et informatiques des conditions pathologiques chez l'homme.

Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in modern biology is to address at the experimental level the analysis of the dynamics of proteome variations in composition and structure in order to decipher the fundamental mechanisms of gene expression and regulation in normal and pathological conditions. In mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the newly developed Simple Light Isotope Metabolic (SLIM) labeling strategy appears to be highly effective to analyze with an unprecedented depth complex proteome in bottom-up and top-down experiments. The aims of this thesis will be: First, to develop robust statistical analysis of the SLIM-labeling based quantitative proteomics procedures. Second, to implement the SLIM-labeling strategy to analyze the quantitative variations of proteoforms in top-down experiments on pathogenic yeast (C.albicans) as model organism to establish robust systems biology approaches. Finally, to implement these methods and protocols on more complex proteome of higher eukaryote cells. The data collection and analysis pipelines set during this work will be applied to the molecular characterization of a number of pathological conditions in humans. We will use different growth media and drugs treatment to evaluate the proteome variations associated to several cell lines from a fatal neurodegenerative disorder studied in the lab (Friedriech Ataxia) where the phenotypic expression is highly dependent on the genomics structure.
